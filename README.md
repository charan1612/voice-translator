# voice-translator

In this project we created a basic Voice Translator using Python and Flask and with the help of html.
The input speech is English format (Which can be changed) and output speech can be in any langugage.
In app.py we have the main logic. We used Google translator libraries to translate the the speech. For the frontend we used HTML.
And in static folder we just store the translated voice recordings
